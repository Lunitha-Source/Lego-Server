# Lego Universe Server

## Our Goal
This is a Lunitha focused fork of [DarkflameServer](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer) designed to create an open-source server implementation that aligns with the ideals of the Lunitha Movement. The mission is transparency and fun, ensuring anyone using this code knows exactly what is happening behind the scenes.  
**This repository serves as a public source code reference** that follows the Lunitha way. Providing complete transparency in server code and modifications for those who wish to preserve and play classic games safely.

## What is LEGO® Universe?
LEGO® Universe was an MMORPG developed by NetDevil and The LEGO Group that launched in October 2010 and ceased operation in January 2012.  
DarkflameServer is a server emulator that allows the game to be played again.

## Our Modifactions
Below are the changes we have made to the original DarkflameServer source:  
| Feature               | Description                                                                 | Status   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Auto Account Creation | Automatically creates new accounts when players log in with new credentials | Applied  |  

**Security**: All passwords are properly hashed using BCrypt before storage.

## Getting Started
**For Players**: This repository is for source code transparency and educational purposes only.  
**For Developers**: If you want to run your own server for personal/educational use, we recommend following the comprehensive setup guide in the [original DarkflameServer respository](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer).

## Transparency & Safety
- **Open Source**: All our modifications are publicly visible
