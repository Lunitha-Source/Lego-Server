# Lego Universe Server

## Our Goal
This is a Lunitha focused fork of [DarkflameServer](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer) designed to provide safe ways to play LEGO® Universe while keeping true to Lunitha's mission. The mission is transparency and fun, ensuring players know exactly what is happening behind the scenes.  
**This repository serves as a public source code reference** so players can verify our server modifications and understand our commitment to transparency.

## What is LEGO® Universe?
LEGO® Universe was an MMORPG developed by NetDevil and The LEGO Group that launched in October 2010 and ceased operation in January 2012.  
DarkflameServer is a server emulator that allows the game to be played again.

## Our Modifactions
Below are the changes we have made to the original DarkflameServer source:  
| Feature               | Description                                                                 | Status   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|

**Security**: All passwords are properly hashed using BCrypt before storage.
